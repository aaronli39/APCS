Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
	Neil Tysson does a good job emphasizing the
idea that every explorer and scientist who contributed
to the knowledge of our cosmos followed the idea of
the Enlightenment. Scientists didn't speculate, rather
they tested current ideas and beliefs, and researched
via experimentation. Viewers experience a sense of
vastness, as we slowly see things in the large scale
of the universe. It's like how Tysson says: the true
nature of our universe is unimaginable, because it's
beyond what we can imagine, unless we see it. The
quality of the documentaries are a shame though, nothing
compared to the HD documentaries and movies we have today,
which put a little more strain on the eye. Everything
in the documentary prompts me to think about whether or
not life exists out in the cosoms, somewhere else in
a magical environment such as Earth.

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
	Tysson brings up an important evolutionary
trait that isn't talked about often: pattern
recognition. The ability for our ancestors to
recognize patterns in nature allowed for their
survival. The word "disastor" itself mean "bad star."
Tysson expands on false patterns, and how our
ability to recognize patterns sometimes cause us to
deceive ourselves, such as the case with coment spotting.
Important figures in history are well connected to the
explanation of Earth and the universe: such as Newton, Halley,
and Oort. The cartoon animations used to portray past events
is likeable and comprehensible. The dialogue and drawings
make it easy to understand what was going on.
