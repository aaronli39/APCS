     The knight should start at 1, 1. Then, the knight will analyze all the moves/spaces it
can move to. It will take one route, and follow it through the end, and whenever there are no
available moves, backtrack one move, and take another route, and so on. Keep backtracking whenever
a move doesn't lead to a solvable configuration.
